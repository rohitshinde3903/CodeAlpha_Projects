## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rohitshinde3903/CodeAlpha_Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Task_1.git
    cd CodeAlpha_Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Task_1
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the Titanic dataset (`titanic.csv`) in the project directory. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to understand the data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization process.
